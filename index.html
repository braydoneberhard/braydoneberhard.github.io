              Throughout this course, I have been learning how to build
              websites from scratch. My name is Braydon and I’d like to show
              you what I built and how I built them.

              I chose web design as it is a valuable skill to have when developing software to make web apps. I found
              that as I
              started learning about it, I realised that there was a lot that falls under the category of “web
              development”.

            <img src="hangman.png" />
          </a>
          This is an interactive Hangman game. It was written in HTML, used
          CSS to make it look good and used javascript to make the game run
          and function. It took me about two weeks on and off to build it but
          most of that was learning how the languages work.

        <div class="two-part">
          <a href="portfolio.html">
            <img src="portfolio.png" />
          </a>The main reason I wanted to develop websites was that I wanted to create a portfolio website that I could
          give to employers to show my skills and that I am capable of building websites. I chose to do this as my
          second to last project as I wanted to develop my skills as much as possible before creating this.

        <div class="two-part">
          <a href="signinpage.html">
            <img src="signinpage.png" />
          </a>I created a sign-in page with dynamic CSS elements that change colour depending on whether or not the
          information is correct. This was my second project as it required some knowledge of limiting factors for the
          email section. </div>
