                Designing websites takes a lot of work. Many people just think they need to learn a programing language,
                write a bit of code and they’re done. This is not the case. Firstly, to build a website, you need to
                know
                at least two languages, these being HTML and CSS. A brief explanation of these is that HTML is what goes
                on the page (buttons, links, text, images etc.) and CSS is how you add colour, shape and move text
                around.
                These are needed to make a static website such as a portfolio or a business website, but there’s another
                big language that is used to add more functionality to a website and that is Javascript. Javascript is
                basically used to handle data and it’s used from projects big and small. It can be as simple as changing
                colours on a website or can be as complex as a whole game.

                You also need a lot of patience. Early on, web design is hard. This is because you’re most likely
                getting
                used to
                learning a new language and learning a lot of new design principles all at once. This makes the learning
                curve for web
                design extremely high but once you get used to all of the concepts it becomes a lot easier
