                Websites can be made in a lot of ways, you could pay someone else to do it for you, which while it may
                look good, it
                would also cost a lot of money and you wouldn’t get the satisfaction of making one on your own. There’s
                Squarespace/Wix
                etc. which is a popular choice these days as you don’t need to pay for a domain name and is extremely
                easy
                to use, the
                downsides of using a site like these is that they all have a certain look and feel to them and they
                aren’t
                personal.
                These are the reasons that I chose to learn to make my own websites.
