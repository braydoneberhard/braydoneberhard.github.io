                The reason that I wanted to create a sign-in page is that it is needed for all websites that have user
                accounts and I thought that it would be a good thing to have under my belt.

              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="three-part">
              <p>
                The creation of it was pretty simple, I started with the background colour and put a grey box on it
                where I would then put the text boxes. I then added colour to the outlines of the text boxes.
