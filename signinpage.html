                The reason that I wanted to create a sign-in page is that it is needed for all websites that have user
                accounts and I thought that it would be a good thing to have under my belt.

                You also need a lot of patience. Early on, web design is hard. This is because youâ€™re most likely
                getting
                used to
                learning a new language and learning a lot of new design principles all at once. This makes the learning
                curve for web
                design extremely high but once you get used to all of the concepts it becomes a lot easier.
