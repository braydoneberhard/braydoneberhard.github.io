              The main reason that I chose to do website design in the first place was that I wanted to build a
              portfolio website to give to employers to show my skills. A lot of software developers have their own
              websites, so much so that itâ€™s almost a cliche.
            </div>

            <div class="three-part">
              </a>
              I started by creating a division in HTML and in CSS I changed the colour to a dark blue header with a
              light blue
              outline.
            </div>
            <div class="three-part">
              </a>
              I then added three buttons to the top right corner leading to the home page, about me page and a projects
              page.
            </div>
            <div class="three-part">
              </a>To make the site not condensed with information, I added a blank section with the page title in it
              which I later added a background image to with the intentions to make it look less bland.
            </div>
            <div class="three-part">
              </a>The final thing that I needed to add was a footer and for this, I wanted to test what I could do with
              CSS animations. So what I did was create four boxes with icons in them for my email, phone number etc. and
              using the animations, I made them fade out and reveal the information
